            <h2>What Is Computer Hardware?</h2>
            <h3>Importance</h3>
            <p>Understanding computer hardware is crucial for anyone interested in building, repairing, or optimizing computers. Each component plays a vital role in the system's overall performance.</p>
            <h3>Main Components</h3>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h3>
                <p>The CPU is the brain of the computer. It performs calculations, runs programs, and processes data. Every instruction that a computer executes is processed by the CPU.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Memory (RAM - Random Access Memory)</h3>
                <p>RAM is the short-term memory of the computer. It temporarily stores data that the CPU needs to access quickly. More RAM allows a computer to handle more tasks simultaneously.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>Storage Devices</h3>
                <p>Storage devices, such as Hard Disk Drives (HDD) and Solid State Drives (SSD), are used for long-term data storage. HDDs use spinning disks to read/write data, while SSDs use flash memory, which is faster and more durable.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Motherboard</h3>
                <p>The motherboard is the main circuit board that connects all components of the computer. It provides connectors for the CPU, RAM, storage devices, and other peripherals, allowing them to communicate with each other.</p>
                <img src="images/motherboard.jpg" alt="Motherboard">
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Power Supply (PSU)</h3>
                <p>The power supply unit converts electrical power from an outlet into usable power for the internal components of the computer. It ensures that each component receives the correct amount of power.</p>

            <h2>Computer Basics: Inside a Computer</h2>
            <h3>Importance</h3>
            <p>Knowing whatâ€™s inside a computer case is crucial for understanding how computers work and how to troubleshoot hardware issues. Each component must work correctly for the system to function optimally.</p>
            <h3>Main Components Inside a Computer Case</h3>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h3>
                <p>The CPU executes instructions from programs, performing calculations and managing tasks. It is typically installed on the motherboard.</p>
